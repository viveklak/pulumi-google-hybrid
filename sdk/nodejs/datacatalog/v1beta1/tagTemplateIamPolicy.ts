Note, this method cannot be used to manage policies for BigQuery, Pub/Sub and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced to Data Catalog. Callers must have following Google IAM permission - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.setIamPolicy` to set policies on tag templates. - `datacatalog.entries.setIamPolicy` to set policies on entries. - `datacatalog.entryGroups.setIamPolicy` to set policies on entry groups.
 * Note - this resource's API doesn't support deletion. When deleted, the resource will persist
